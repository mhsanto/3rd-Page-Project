That’s the weight of an American Bison, at birth… or more sensibly, the weight of 75 of your favourite paperbacks.</p>

           <p class="para"> Our Downward ‘L’ brackets because the bottom fixing hole is behind where the wood sits - in this case, it makes more sense to complete the attachment in situ, but it is a straightforward task.</p>
           <p class="para">Our upward ‘L’ bracket shelves are also sent with the brackets not attached, as lots of people use these shelves above radiators then we feel this gives you freedom to place the brackets where suits you best.</p>
